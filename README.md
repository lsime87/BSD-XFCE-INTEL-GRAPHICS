# BSD-XFCE
BSD-XFCE is a collection of scripts and FreeBSD filesystem configurations to install a full-fledged and high-performant XFCE enviroment specially optimized for desktop and workstation use without the hassle and with a very beautiful looking for classic OS X users.

## DISCLAIMER: This project doesn't want to be a "OS X clone on FreeBSD" or whatever. The installation of the macOS skinpack is totally optional, the base system installation and configurations are the big deal.

## Before installation
Read the code before install, you would like to change some parameters (Nvidia driver version suitable for your GPU, sound devices, webcams...)

## Installation (FreeBSD 13/13.*/14)

```
git clone https://github.com/lsime87/BSD-XFCE-INTEL-GRAPHICS/blob/main/xfce_desktop_intel_drivers.sh
```
## Post-installation (macOS skinpack) <- Optional step **AFTER** reboot
```
IMPORTANT! Run these scripts with your user, not root.

Step 1: cd xfce4BSD-macOS_skinpack/resources/ && sudo sh install_resources.sh
Step 2 (As regular user): cd xfce4BSD-macOS_skinpack/configurations/ && sh apply.sh
```
## Creative Suite <- Optional step **AFTER** reboot
```
sudo sh BSD-XFCE/creative_suite.sh
```
Please, use this scripts only in a fresh FreeBSD installation.

At some point, the script will ask you for username to enable XFCE start exec and other services like automount capabilities.

## SUPPORT
Please, open an issue if you need help or want to suggest something. I will try my best :)
